# Log Monitoring & Analysis – Documentation

## 1. Introduction
Log monitoring is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting system-generated logs to detect suspicious activities, unauthorized access attempts, and system failures.

## 2. What is a Log?
A log is a recorded event generated by systems, applications, or network devices that stores information such as:
- Login attempts
- System errors
- Application activity
- Network connections

## 3. Types of Security Logs
- Authentication logs
- System logs
- Application logs
- Firewall logs
- Network device logs

## 4. Authentication Log Analysis
Authentication logs record login attempts including:
- Username
- Source IP
- Login time
- Success or failure

Repeated failed login attempts may indicate brute-force attacks.

## 5. Anomaly Detection
An anomaly is unusual behavior compared to normal activity such as:
- Multiple login failures
- Login from unknown location
- Unusual access times
- Sudden privilege escalation

## 6. Event Correlation
Event correlation links multiple log events together to detect attack patterns such as:
Failed login attempts followed by successful login from same IP.

## 7. SIEM Concept
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems collect logs from multiple sources, analyze them in real-time, and generate alerts for suspicious behavior.

## 8. Importance of Log Monitoring
- Detect cyber attacks early
- Investigate incidents
- Maintain compliance
- Improve system security posture
